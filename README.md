# Faithful_s_Portfolio


# Description

Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. This Portfolio was created with that intent.  

# Design 

Ensured the site look polished - I chose a color palette for the site,I made sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
